## Project Name: Husky Job Application Tracker

This project originates from a [Mobile Development class project](https://github.com/cathyfu1215/huskyJobHuntTracker), which is designed by me, and implemented by me and my teammate Serena. We received help and advices from professor Neda, teaching assistant Min and lots of classmates.

I am willing to improve this product after the class ends, so I started this new repo.
I will fix the existing bugs, improve the UX design and add more features to this product.
I hope it will help more students in the job hunt season!
